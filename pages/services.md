## Strategic Planning

At Edith Quiroz Consulting, I can help you work with your board and staff to plan, develop and guide the execution of a long-term strategic plan that identifies the top goals for your organization, along with detailed strategies and timelines that will enable you to reach those goals.

Together, we will focus on the big hairy audacious goals (BHAG), value proposition, funding strategy to support your clientele. These conversations will include your board, stakeholders, volunteer staff to incorporate all input and craft a strategy that is a win-win for your niche.

Finally, I will develop not just the final report, but be available to the board chair to put into place an accountability structure so that the plan becomes a living document that guides your organization’s work on a day-to-day and long-term basis.
