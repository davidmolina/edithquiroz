Edith Quiroz is an accomplished nonprofit executive, startup founder, radio host and proud mother of three. Edith supports non-profits in the areas of executive search & recruitment, interim directorships, diversity, equity and inclusion training and coaching, board training and development, strategic planning, and professional development training.

### Undergraduate to Professional

Edith was born in Mexico City, the ancient city of Tenochtitlan. Her mother, Olivia, and father, Evodio, immigrated the family to The Dalles, Oregon (84 miles east of Portland) in the mid-80s where the family started a new life as seasonal migrant farm workers and when Oregon's lumber industry was booming in the saw mills. During high school, Edith, attended Oregon's Hispanic Migrant Student Leadership Program and was motivated afterwards to attend college. Frustrated with waiting for her citizenship caught in red-tape, Edith sought the help of Oregon Congresswoman Darlene Hooley and status was soon granted allowing Edith to attend her first choice⎯Oregon State University.

As an undergraduate, Edith was the creator of the Conexiones Program, a Chicano/Latino freshman orientation program for first-generation students and their families. As external coordinator of the Centro Cultural César Chávez, Edith co-led the student effort to protect the cultural centers on campus, a signator to the covenenant, and was recipient of the [Frances Dancy Hooks Award](https://diversity.oregonstate.edu/MLK%20Commemoration/legacy-awards/frances-dancy-hooks-award). Before graduating with a bachelor's in sociology and ethnic studies, Edith founded the [Mujeres Despertando Conciencia Conference](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/you-cant-escape-your-true-calling-edith-molina) in 2002 bringing Mexican and Latina housewives and non-professionals together to network for personal and professional growth, and share each other's stories.

## Early Career

Edith began her career at Portland-based, Susannah Maria Gurule (SMG) Foundation as their first Director of Las Hermanas Program where she managed, administered and coordinated an award-winning culturally and linguistically tailored program for young Latina women at two-site locations: Portland and Woodburn. As program director, Edith developed and prepared curriculums, and provided dedicated academic advice and mentorship impacting 75 Latina college-bound women, all while managing a $250,000.00 budget.

At the age of 26 and despite being told she was too young, Edith co-founded RED Consulting Group, a consultancy and bilingual recruiting company conducting executive searches and trainings for nonprofit and private sector clients throughout the state. The firm was later renamed to BilingualHire, and along with her co-founder and ex-husband built BilingualHire to more effectively serve the diverse employer needs and growth of bilingual talent.

A creative, Edith founded the [Radio Tonalli Show](https://www.facebook.com/tonalli.show/) on Portland's KBOO 90.7FM co-producing and co-hosting a much needed intellectual conversation within the Spanish-speaking community. During her tenure, Edith interviews ranged from Portland Mayor Tom Potter, health expert Dr. Yves Lefranc to Mexican actress/ social activist icon Yareli Arizmendi all while creating a safe space for the Latino community to discuss political, social and economic issues in a dialogue and community-driven format.

## Public and Civic Experience

Never forgetting where she comes from, Edith served Oregon's migrant families as the state's Migrant Health Coordinator providing technical support and assistance in the development of new and existing Federally Qualified Health Centers traveling and meeting extensively with both healthcare providers and seasonal migrant farmworkers.

At the height of H1N1, Edith served as the state director's point person for all communication to diverse communities. As the state's Health Equity and Emergency Preparedness Coordinator, Edith administered and monitored $300,000.00 federal and state grants to community-based organizations to develop culturally specific programs and outreach.

A strong believer in giving back, a value instilled by her father and Evangelical preacher, Edith served on the Portland Women's Union Foundation (now Women's Foundation of Oregon) providing key advice on grantmaking to Latina women serving nonprofits, a term on the Oregon MEChA Statewide Board of Directors, as Chair of the Oregon Latino Health Coalition, and Board of Directors of Familias en Acción.

In addition to founding ThinkMujer, a one-day professional development and careering networking summit for Latinas, Edith served as Faculty Cohort in the [2016 Leading for Equity and Inclusion Cohort](https://www.nonprofitoregon.org/page/2016-leading-equity-and-inclusion-Cohort), an annual program designed to support nonprofit executive directors in becoming transformational leaders building equity and inclusion within their organizations.
